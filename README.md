# 2024 Research Internship Public Code

This repository contains code written during my École polytechnique 3rd year resarch internship with specialization MAP594 - *Modélisation probabiliste et statistique* (probabilistic and statistical modelling). This internship took place under the supervision of Jo Eidsvik at the Center for Geophysical Forecasting (CGF) from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU, *Norges teknisk-naturvitenskapelige universitet*).

Since the Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) data I used is not open-access, this code is not enough to reproduce the results exposed in the report. However, it can help in understanding how I came to these results.
